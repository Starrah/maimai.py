# LocalProvider

Implementation: IItemListProvider, IAreaProvider

Given that some collection data does not have open APIs available, we provide a local collection data source for storing collection data that cannot be obtained through APIs.

## About Collections

Currently included collections are:

`PlayerIcon`, `PlayerNamePlate`, `PlayerFrame`, `PlayerTrophy`, `PlayerChara`, `PlayerPartner`

# About Map Areas

The local data source provides data for some map areas, offering original Japanese area names and Chinese translations.

The Chinese translation files may be incomplete or outdated. Pull requests are welcome to help us improve these data.
